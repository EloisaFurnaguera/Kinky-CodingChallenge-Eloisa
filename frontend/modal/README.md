# Kink.com Coding Challenge - Modal

## Goal

Using the code in this directory as a starting point, create a confirmation modal that asks the user to confirm their intent after clicking the **Cancel** button.

## Requirements

- When the user mouses over the **Cancel** button, the mouse pointer should indicate that it is a clickable link.
- The modal window should include the following:
	* Text: `Are you sure you want to cancel your subscription?`
	* **No** button on the left
	* **Yes - Cancel** button on the right
- When the user clicks the **No** button, the modal should disappear.
- When the user clicks the **Yes - Cancel** button:
	* The modal's content should be updated to display the text `Subscription successfully cancelled!`. This modal should close after 2 seconds.
	* The **cancel** button on the page should be replaced with the text `cancelled`.

## Guidelines

- All code should be written in ES6 JavaScript.
- You may use third-party JavaScript or CSS libraries to complete this task, but it is not required.
- You may edit any of the files as necessary to complete the task, but it is not required.
- Documentation and maintainability is a plus.

### Time Allotment

We respect your time and would prefer you not spend more than 3-5 hours. Feel free to include code comments to indicate any features you don't have time to implement.
