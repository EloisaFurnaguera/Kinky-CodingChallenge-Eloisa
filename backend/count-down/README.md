# Kink.com Backend Coding Challenge - Count Down

## Challenge 1

Create a JavaScript function that takes an integer and counts down to zero `0` printing each iteration.

### Example

If the given integer is `5`, the output should be:

```
5
4
3
2
1
0
```

## Challenge 2

Create a JavaScript function that takes a single `alpha` (`a-z`) character and counts down to `a` printing each iteration.

### Example

If the given character is `f`, the output should be:

```
f
e
d
c
b
a
```

## Challenge 3

Create a JavaScript function that takes a string of `alpha` characters (`a-z`, no spaces) and counts down each character in the string until all of the characters are `a`.

### Example

If the given string is `food`, the output should be:

```
food
eood
dood
cood
bood
aood
znod // Notice 'a' -> 'z' and 'o' -> 'n'
ynod
xnod
...
bdod
adod
zcod // Notice 'a' -> 'z' and 'd' -> 'c'
...
aaaa
```

### Bonus

Instead of decreasing the first character in the string, decrease from the last character.

```
food
fooc
foob
fooa
fonz // Notice 'o' -> 'n' and 'a' -> 'z'
fony
fonx
...
fonb
fona
fomz // Notice 'n' -> 'm' and 'a' -> 'z'
...
aaaa
```

## Guidelines

- All code should be written in JavaScript and executed using Node.js 8.
- No third-party libraries or plugins are allowed.
- Documentation and maintainability is a plus.

### Time Allotment

We respect your time and would prefer you not spend more than 3-5 hours on these challenges. Feel free to include code comments to indicate any features you don't have time to implement.
